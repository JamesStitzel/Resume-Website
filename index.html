        "Well lets start at the begining, on the 30th of March, during the first year of the second millenium I was born in Plant City Florida in our small local hospital.
         Once I was able to sucessfully master the precise calculus of locomotion, with my hands now free of the ground, I immediatly began my lifelong interest with technology. 
         I would take apart computers to see how they worked, i'd install games and programs of dubious reputation, all the while exploring the capabilities of the technology at my disposal. 
         My first real job in the tech industry was an afterschool arangement at a independent computer repair shop in downtown Plant City. The pay was only minimum wage, but i was thrilled
         just to be in contact with more technology than i could inventory (trust me I tried). After about a year of working at the shop, the realization that minimum wage wouldnt cut it anymore was becoming
         more and more clear with each rotation of the earth. After much deliberation I politely tendered my resignation and then proceeded to work at Steak and Shake as a server for about a year,
         but then due to car troubles i was required to find work closer to home. Subway became that answer, there I became the store manager after only 8 months which i was proud of for a time, until 
         the owners ended up firing everyone but me and not so nicely asking me to work asnine hours. I again politely handed in my resignation and found a job in the industrial electrical sales industry, i knew
         nothing about industrial electrical sales but i was determined to give it the old college try. After a few months working in the warehouse familiarizing myself with the products, and the cavalcade
         of model numbers I was put into a real sales position. I interacted daily with many electricians and project managers, as with all people some where unbearable jerks but on the whole, a jovial and fun lot.
         I used a computer with many shortcuts and different shorthand model numbers that would auto populate to the full products. Remembering all the terminology and jargon, was interesting in its own way,
         but i knew that what I really wanted was a job that used computers as a matter of course; not just recently in the last 10 years because it increased efficiency for the company, but because computers and
         software on them would be the product. My lifelong ambitions realized, and thats what being a developer means to me.
